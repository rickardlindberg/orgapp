- Report bad items
    - Meta bad
    - Meta and file missmatch

- Handle incorrect imports
    - Partial import where only meta was created
    - Imports should be atomic: either everything was successful or disk not
      changed
    - Importing a file that is already inside the bucket
    - Import file from /tmp causes rename error (cross device bla bla)

    - crashes
        - open app
        - import bar
        - close app
        - open app
        - import bar
        -> Main: /home/rick/org-app-bucket/bar-1: createDirectory: already exists
        (File exists)

    - different named files
        - spaces (names, directories)
        - meta.txt
            - collides with hard coded meta file
        - .file could result in "" item name
            - "" item name should be prevented
        - file contains chars illegal in dir names (which?)
        - schr√∂dingers cat encoding problem

- Error cases to handle
    - Opening item which has disappeared from disk
        - Perhaps not a problem since it will be handled by external command
    - When things go wrong (permission error, disk full)
    - When bucket has changed on disk

- Repair bucket
    - re-create meta.txt for items that miss it

- Infrastructure
    - Automatically find tests in modules
